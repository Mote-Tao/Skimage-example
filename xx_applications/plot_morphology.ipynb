        "\n# Morphological Filtering\n\n\nMorphological image processing is a collection of non-linear operations related\nto the shape or morphology of features in an image, such as boundaries,\nskeletons, etc. In any given technique, we probe an image with a small shape or\ntemplate called a structuring element, which defines the region of interest or\nneighborhood around a pixel.\n\nIn this document we outline the following basic morphological operations:\n\n1. Erosion\n2. Dilation\n3. Opening\n4. Closing\n5. White Tophat\n6. Black Tophat\n7. Skeletonize\n8. Convex Hull\n\n\nTo get started, let's load an image using ``io.imread``. Note that morphology\nfunctions only work on gray-scale or binary images, so we set ``as_grey=True``.\n\n"
